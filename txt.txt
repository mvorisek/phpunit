Native `assert` assertion are used a lot. They are becoming even more popular together with static analysers to eliminate cases that should not happen.

However `assert` evaluation is disabled on many systems as it is default php.ini for production [1]. Production php.ini is default in official Docker images [2] and even popular Github Actions `setup-php` [3]. This leads to `assert` assertions very often untested as most, at least CI environments, does not have them enabled.

This PR enables `assert` evaluation before any test. If a test, for some ugly reasons, requires `assert` disabled, user can simply override the php.ini in code in given test.

fix #3146, fix #1897
